This is a repository of a project I have worked during my Data Science studies in MundosE from the University of Cordoba, Argentina.
I have been going my head around the problems we face whenever we want to start a psychological treatment and we need to chose the profesiional we want to start working with. In Argentina, there are mainly two ways in whcih you get to your therapist: 
1. Recommendation
2. Your Healthcare service makes a couple of questions and selects a therapists for you.

However, neither of these two assures you the matching a psychologist that you will most probably find confortable with and make progress. That's why I have designed this classification model: to get patternd and clasify which psychological specialty suits the best to each patient.
